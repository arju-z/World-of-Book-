            <h2><u>THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GREY</u></h2>
            <p>By OSCAR WIDE</p>
            Dorian Gray is the decadent archetype, anti-hero of Oscar Wildes only novel, an underground classic which scandalized society upon its publication in 1890. Gray is the debauched libertine who retains a veneer of eternal youth during decades of increasingly outlandish vice, depravity and corruption, while his portrait ages and rots in an attic. Here in its rare original incarnation, the overtly homoerotic Lippincott edition, it includes an appendix sampling Wildes later revisions, with an introduction by Jeremy Reed detailing the two editions and realigning the books position in the history of subversive underground fiction. With its outr elements of homosexuality, drug abuse and supernatural horror, this remains Wildes most extreme creation, a true classic of renegade literature.<BR><BR>

            <H2><U>13 REASONS WHY?</U></H2>
            <P>By JAY ASHER</P>
            <p>Though the novel isn't based on a true story, Asher did open up about the situations being based “loosely” on situations that happened in real life. “All of the reasons Hannah describes were based, at least loosely, on situations I'd either experienced or heard about, mostly from my wife or close female friends</p>

                <P>By LOUIS LOWRY</P>
                <p>The Giver” begins in a very interesting way and catches the attention of the readers from the beginning. It has easy-to-understand grammar. Most of the grammar is just past simple and past perfect.

                    All of the sentences are short and there is no confusion in the story. This is a longer book, but it’s quite easy, so you’ll finish it quickly. The book’s genre is science fiction, meaning it’s about a world that doesn’t exist in real life.</p>
